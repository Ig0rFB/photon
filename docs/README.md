# Using Photon+

## Introduction

This will give you a brief introduction to using your Photon+ as well as the use of incident light meters in general.

### Incident vs Reflective metering

When photographing something (we'll call that the **subject**) there are two types of light metering:

- Incident metering, measuring the light **falling** on the subject
- Reflective metering, measuring the light **reflecting** off the subject

An question you need to ask yourself when using reflective metering is "what the light is reflecting off?". A lump of coal under bright light will reflect more light than a snowball under dim light. Unless you factor this in to your choice of aperture/shutterspeed then you will run into issues with your exposure.
