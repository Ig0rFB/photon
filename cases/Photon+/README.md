A place for the case elements for the flashmeter version that uses the [new sensor](https://www.veeb.ch/projects/flash-aaahhh-ahhhhhh). The fast sensor allows for the addition of a flash modem while still being able to perform the same metering as the original design. 
There are also some tweaks based on the PicoLipo case. The sensor now sits inside the case and the case is much more sealed than the first version.
